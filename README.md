# Structural Bioinformatics Workshop resources

This repo contains the resources required for my structural bioinformatics workshop.

There are two versions of the workshop - one version uses Pymol, the other uses the web based protein visualising app NGL.

If you are feeling adventurous/have Pymol already installed, feel free to use the [Pymol version](./workshop_pymol.md).

Otherwise, use the [NGL version](./workshop_ngl.md)

### If you get stuck...

If things don't work (always a possibility with academic software), the [data](./data) folder contains various files (including the homology model PDB file) so you can use them in a pinch. 

Please - **only use if stuff doesn't work**.
